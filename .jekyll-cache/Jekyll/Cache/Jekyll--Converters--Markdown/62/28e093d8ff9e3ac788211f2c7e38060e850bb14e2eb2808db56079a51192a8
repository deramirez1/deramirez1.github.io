I"?<p>I’m quite the avid proponent of <a href="https://brilliant.org/">Brilliant.org</a>. It’s a great way to refine, build, and practice new mathematical concepts. I’m going to do a series of Brillant posts, one every week, on a very specific topic in math. This week, and post number 1, is spherical geometry.</p>
