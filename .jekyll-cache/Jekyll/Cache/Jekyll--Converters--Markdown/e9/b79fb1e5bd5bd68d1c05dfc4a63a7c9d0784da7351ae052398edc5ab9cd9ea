I"<p>Number theory is a very interesting field of mathematics I’ve only recently became interested in. This week it looks like Euler’s Totient Function will be the topic, as always you can follow along at the <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/eulers-totient-function/">wiki</a>. Euler’s Totient Functions (also called the Phi function) counts the number of positive integers less than \(n\) that are coprime to \(n\). Coprime is just a way of saying that any pair of two numbers only share 1 as their greated common divisor.</p>
